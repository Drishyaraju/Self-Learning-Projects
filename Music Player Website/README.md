"I used modern HTML and CSS to create a fully responsive Music Player App Design with my preferred color theme.
I employed CSS Flexbox, Media queries for responsive design, and CSS transitions for some cool animation effects.
This project includes sections like Sidebar, Music Player, Header, Genre, and Top Musics.
I learned these techniques from YouTube, got inspired, and implemented them."
